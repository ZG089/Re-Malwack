## How does it work? - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> [!TIP]
> **How does this module block websites and what modifications were made?**
> - How does it block websites: It modifies `hosts` file to block websites and malware by denying access for your phone to connect to it at all. It will just return a blank page.


> [!TIP]
> **Does it blocks in-app ads and in-game ads as well ?**
> - Yes, it does.

> [!TIP]
> **There's a problem when using the module**
> - Export logs via module WebUI, then create an [issue](https://github.com/ZG089/Re-Malwack/issues) explaining your problem and attach ss of the problem if there is any. You can also report your problem in our [telegram support group](https://t.me/Re_Malwack)

> [!TIP]
> **AdBlock doesn't work on some apps (ex: Chrome), or doesn't work completely**
> - Make sure you have disabled umount for the target app (if you use KernelSU), also make sure you disabled LiteMode (if you use APatch). If nothing works then create an [issue](https://github.com/ZG089/Re-Malwack/issues) about it or report the problem in our [telegram support group](https://t.me/Re_Malwack)
