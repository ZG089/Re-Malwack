## Licensing

Hey! Quick note about the `jq` binaries! They're open-source but come with their own license (not our GPL v3). We've included the pre-compiled versions for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` architectures because they're super useful, but just remember they're under different terms than the rest of this repo!
